<h2>History:</h2>
<p>
CGRU project was started in 2005 as Maya (3d software name) tools pack.
It included 3d modeling tools and rules. And was designed to join Maya MEL scripts and plug-ins from several artists.
It still <a href="../plugins/maya/doc/index.html">exists</a> but as a part of the project.
Later the project started to include tools for other software and a render farm manager.
Moved on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgru/">SourceForge</a> site and lost all not open-source tools.
Modeling rules lost support and became ancient.
But an idea to store some accumulated CG rules still exists.
Now there are mot much rules, no modeling rules at all.
Also rules got a <a href="cgrules.html">funny</a> shade as companies have enough serious rules.
</p>
<p>
Afanasy was started in 2007.
In 2008 a fist working alpha version started to solve jobs on real VFX projects in "Film Direction" (Russia).
It was merged with CGRU project on SourceForge and became open-source.
Now it is a main part of CGRU project and other tools can be considered as an utilities for it.
So we may say that CGRU consist of Afanasy render manager and some ready solutions for it,
like submit scripts or movie encode scripts, for example.

<h2>Paper</h2>
<p>
There is some paper, but only in Russian.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="http://cgru.info/doc/rus_doklad/index.html">Paper (rus)</a> <a href="rus_doklad/index.html">(local link)</a><br/></li></ul>
It is about render managers generally, Afanasy idea, why it was written, who is interested in.
If somebody going to translate it in English, please contact, it is really needed.
Paper has some funny shade, it is done not to bore people that are not vary familiar with the theme, may be with computers at all.
As practically 90% of people in auditorium do not really know why they are there, but payed some money.
