If Afanasy <b>network protocol changed</b>, it became incompatible with old one.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The first number in version means some major changes in the project.</li>
<li>The second number means compatibility lost.
You should upgrade all clients and server at the same.</li>
<li>The third number versions are fully compatible.

	Parser can return running task "activity" - string parameter.
	For example Nuke can notificate which of stereo views is rendering now.
	Movie Maker notificates whether an encoding is started.
	Activity string is shown by AfWatch and WebGUI in job tasks list window for each task item.
</p>
<p>
	Render has an idle time parameter.
	It shows time since CPU percentage is less a value specified in config.
	AfWatch shows progress bar - how long render is idle or how much time before Wake-On-Lan sleep, if render is "sleepable".

	Afanasy configuration now has parameters to control user ability to change priority:
	<kbd>af_perm_user_mod_his_priority</kbd> and

</p>
<p>
	One config file can include another file(s).
	Specify a files to be included in "include" string array.
	All include files will be included after all file will be read (not like include directive in most common program languages).
	This is done to override file contents.
	Any next occurrence of a variable with the same name will override previous value.
</p>
<p>
	Config file can have OS specific section.
	So you can setup different OS-es configs in the same file.

	Paths map setup moved to common config files.
	And you can setup paths map for all OS-es in the same file.
</p>
<p>
	Some general config parameters, as time format, maximum file name length, command shell, preview commands,
	moved from Afanasy specific config to global CGRU config.
	As they can be used later by other CGRU tools.
</p>
<p>
	Afanasy on start-up reads CGRU config file and does not tries to find some specific config itself.

	So now <b>all components in CGRU has LGPL license</b> or similar.
</p>
<p>
	New Linux package <b><i>afanasy-qtgui</i></b> appeared.

API is based on <a href="../afanasy/doc/json.html">JSON</a> now.
Python API is the same but no binary module needed, it communicates with server itself by JSON build-in module.
(All Python API is written on Python language, not on Python C API.)
You can communicate with Afanasy server within any language/script that can create JSON structures.
(No libafanasy needed to send and get data, all possible linking problems are in the past.)
</p>
<p>
<i>JSON protocol is not finished. Finished only job structure - to remove python binary module dependence to send a job.</i>
</p>
<p>

	Tasks can be solved in a not-sequential manner.
	For example 1-10: 0 9 5 2 7 1 3 6 8 4<br/>
	This can be needed to catch some error earlier and to calculate average running time more accurate.
</p>
<p>
	You can hide jobs or renders in AfWatch by some parameter.
	Also you can show only hidden nodes.
	And a new "hidden" parameter was added to every node (job, render) just to hide (and store hidden state).
</p>
<p>
	Bugs Fixed:
</p>
<p>
	AfWatch can preview tasks of a not-numeric blocks in a task information window (by double click).<br/>
	This is a main reason of this release.<br/>

	Render will launch tasks commands with it. Default values are:<br/>
	<i>UNIX</i>: "/bin/bash -c"<br/>
	<i>MS Windows</i>: "cmd.exe /c"<br/>
</p>
<p>
	Administrator (super users) can change job owner. It can be performed by AfWatch GUI and afcmd CLI.

Connections form addresses not matching specified masks will be ignored by server.
</p>
<p>
User can set jobs solving method to parallel.
</p>
<p>
Afanasy now supports only PostgreSQL database engine.
QtSql library replaced with native PostgreSQL libpq in libafsql module.
So there is no Qt in afserver and afcmd applications (as later Qt was removed from libafanasy).
Do not forget to update you server database connection settings, if you override defaults.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Bugs Fixed:

<p>
Afanasy Starter error message in console fixed, sending a job and with Python 2.x (Fedora Linux raises a warning in system tray in this case).<br/>
Paths map works in lower case mode on windows and only in client -> server direction (So you can use paths with uppercase letters with UNIX clients and MS Windows).<br/>

<p>
System job commands queue can be cleared by restarting task.
</p>
<p>
Technical:
</p>
<p>
Default Python version is 2.7.1. Default Qt version is 4.7.2.<br/>
XML parser moved from Qt to <a href="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net">RapidXML</a>. No library needed, they are realized by headers only.<br/>
Regular expressions moved from Qt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">POSIX</a>, they are almost the same. No library needed. They are in C standard, already realized in GCC and MSVC>=2008SP1.<br/>
No Qt needed for <i>libafanasy</i> and so for <i>libafapi</i> and <i>libpyaf</i> too. No errors can happen importing Python module in other software using Qt.<br/>
Windows version moved to static Qt libraries. No errors can happen with various Qt "dll"s in PATH.<br/>
If parsing is no needed, parser should have an empty string name. Render do not tries to import parser module with an empty name, no error happen.
</p>
<p>
Bugs Fixed:
</p>
<p>
Nuke render script: A try to delete moved temporary image removed.<br/>
Listen job and task output connection error fixed.<br/>
Numeric command frame(s) replacement bug fixed. Now it replaces any number of %04d patterns with start and end frame in a cycle.
(The bug appears for example on a composite commands: "cmd1 && cmd2" or "cmd1; cmd2". And when one task has several files for preview.)<br/>
Maya Auto Save Manager history backup filename from date and time construct on MS Windows bug fixed.<br/>
