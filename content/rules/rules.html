<h2 id="ru_online" class="anchor">Online Version</h2>
<p>
Rules online:
<a href="http://cgru.info/rules" target="_blank">http://cgru.info/rules</a>
</p>
<p>
	Online version has some limitations:
	<ul>
	<li>Your machine does not have an access to its filesystem, so browser can`t open folders and files.</li>
	<li>There is no Afanasy, so it can't send jobs, you can't create dailies from images sequences.</li>
	<li>There is no video and image conversion tools, you can't generate thumbnails.</li>
	<li>Web server does not have authentication mechanisms,
		so you can access files typing direct links to them.
		If you do not have permissions to some location, it will be just hidden in RULES GUI.
		But such public place is not designed to keep any private information.
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	For example we have a viewing room with a computer with a huge display.
	To show shot (images sequence) user puts it in a playlist.

<p>
	For example, to put file in 'SHOT/WORK/ART' folder and comment it in a shot,
	you should go to that folder, drag and drop file(s) in upload field,
	go back (upper) to the shot, and make a comment.
	File will be uploaded in 'SHOT/WORK/ART' as it was dropped there,
	link and a thumbnail to the file will be attached to comment.
</p>

<h3 id="ru_sidepan_perm" class="anchor">Permissions</h3>
<p>
	This is where administrators can control users permissions.
	Permissions are stored in the same way as Apache server understands.
	To if you dined some folder to some users (groups), direct links will not works too.
	No way to hack RULES unless you can hack Apache.
</p>
<p>
	Both, and Apache and RULES GUI understands permission setup when you can
	deny upper folder but give access to some child folder(s).
	So you can give access only to special shots of a projects.
