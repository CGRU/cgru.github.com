<p>
	Branch is like a folder in a filesystem.
	Branch contains child branches (folders) and jobs (files),
	so there is a hierarchy of a branches (folders) and jobs (files).
	Branches are designed to combine and manipulate a set of similar (department, project, scene, asset) jobs.
</p>

<h3 class="anchor" id="branch_creation">Branches Creation</h3>
<p>
	The first <i>ROOT</i> branch will be created by the system job.
</p>
<p>
	Any job has a sting attribute <kbd>branch</kbd>.
	When job comes to server, it looks whether the job branch exists.
	If branch exists, this branch becomes a new job parent.
	If branch does not exist, server ties to find the parent branch of a new job branch.
	And it tries to find a parent of a parent in a cycle (recursion).
	When it find matching parent branch (it must do it, as a root branch always exists),
	It tries to create a child branch if <i>Auto Create Child</i> <kbd>ACC</kbd> flag is set.
	If the flag is not set, job will be parented to the most base branch in the branches hierarchy.
	And job <kbd>branch</kbd> will be updated to the actual parent that server could found/created.
