<h2>Afanasy Paths Map</h2>

<p>
CGRU has an ability to map paths.
Every client can have own paths map file to translate paths to server and from server.
</p>
<p>
Paths map is described in <a href="#configuration.html">config</a> files by <kbd>pathsmap</kbd> object.
It is an arrays of path pairs:
</p>

<pre>
"pathsmap":[
	["//server/projects/","/mnt/prj/"],
	["//server/tools/","/mnt/tools/"]
]
</pre>

<p>
When job constructs (on the client side) all commands and working directories are translated from client to server.
When task starts (on the client side) all commands and working directories are translated from server to client.
Server does know nothing about paths map.
</p>

<h3>MS Windows platform issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
You can write only <code>/</code> slashes in a config.
It will try both slashes directions.
Some applications allows client to use and <code>\</code> and <code>/</code> slashes,
so pattern will be matched in any case.
</li>
<li>
When client searches a pattern it converts paths in lower case.
So no matter how client wrote a path '//server/projects/', '//SERVER/PROJECTS/', '//SERVER/projects/' or '//server/PROJECTS/'.
It will work any way.
</li>
<li>
Module (Python Class) can works in 'UnixSeparators' mode.
During translation from server to client it uses <code>\</code> slashes for client paths.
For example NUKE uses only <code>\</code> slashes on any platform.
</li>
</ul>
