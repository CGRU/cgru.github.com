CGRU configuration based on JSON files.
One config file can include other, where parameters can be overridden.
Config file can contain OS specific section, which parameters will be read only if client platform parameters matches OS section name.
</p>
<p>
At first <kbd>cgru/config_default.json</kbd> is read, where global parameters are set.
It includes <kbd>cgru/afanasy/config.json</kbd> which configures Afanasy specific parameters.
At last it tries to load <kbd>cgru/config.json</kbd>, where you should override some your company specific parameters.
At least you should specify Afanasy server location in it.
</p>
<p>
CGRU Keeper and AfWatch stores settings in <kbd>HOME/.cgru/config.json</kbd>.
It is read with the same rules as the main config.
User can use it to set its own properties and override global config settings.
</p>
<p>
Each parameter should be preset only once in a config file.
If there will several parameters with the same name in a same file, which will be chosen is undefined.
Parameters order plays no role.
Included files are read after the end of file, no matter where include line is.
If in the next included file there will be a parameter with the same name, it value will be overridden.

Better to check config with <kbd>afcmd</kbd>. Just run this command with no arguments.
On error it will output error message, position and some text around it.
You can also view configuration in Keeper, but it can not to start on bad config at all.
Keeper Configuration window will display result configuration and each config file contents in the order they where read (included).

<p>
* There is no comments in JSON syntax. But there are ways to comment JSON files.
For example you can create an object with no name: <br/>
<kbd>"":"Some comment text."</kbd><br/>
Or create an object with some unused name.
To disable (comment) some parameter you can change it name to unused.
For example you can just prefix name with "-".
