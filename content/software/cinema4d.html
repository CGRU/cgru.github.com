<h3>Submission</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Job Name</b> - Afanasy job name. Default is the scene-name</li>
<li><b>Overwrite Output</b> - Overwrites the Render-Output-Path</li>
<li><b>Priority</b> - Job order in user jobs list ('-1' means to keep this value default)</li>
<li><b>Framerange</b> - Framerange to render on the farm</li>
<li><b>By Frame</b> - Just renders every x frame. By default this is 1 so it renders every frame</li>
<li><b>Bake Constraints</b> - Bakes the constraints and then saves a copy of the scene which gets rendered (currently it only bakes xxx)</li>
<li><b>Do not copy Scene to Hosts</b> - By default it copies the scene and the textures locally to the farm and also renders the images locally. After it finished it copies then the finished renderings back to the server. If this is not wanted for some reason it can get deactivated here and it loads everything from the farm and saves directly to the farm</li>
<li><b>Create Job Paused</b> - The submitted job is then paused and has to be started manually</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Frames per Task</b> - Number of frames in each task</li>
<li><b>Max Hosts</b> - Maximum number of Hosts to use (0 means to keep the default value)</li>
<li><b>Max Runtime (min)</b> - How long a frame is allowed to render maximum before it gets requed</li>
<li><b>Capacity</b> - Tasks capacity value</li>
</ul>

<h3>Masks</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Hosts Mask</b> - Hosts names pattern where job can run on (empty value means that job can run on host with any name)</li>
<li><b>Exclude Hosts Mask</b> - Hosts names pattern where job can not run on</li>
<li><b>Depend Mask</b> - Same user jobs names pattern to wait to be done to start (empty value means not to wait any job)</li>
